Have been busy at work: trying to optimize communications for multi-rank GPU numerical simulations (with MPI). Aside from that, I've been trying to get better at concurrency. I've had more experience with parallel computing, but concurrency has been a little tougher for me. I've been doing some <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> courses and reading <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action">Concurrency in Action</a>.

I'm trying to get a stronger feeling of values: specifically <i>rvalues</i> and <i>lvalues</i>.
</p>

<p>Aside from work stuff, I think the biggest anxieties in my life are out of my control: a reorganization at work where everyone has been made to apply for their positions and the 2024 election.<p>
