So, undergoing a massive reorganization at work and also the 2024 election.  I'll be happy when both of these are over.  Aside from that, I have been busy work (working on MPI optimizations), trying to get better at concurrency.  I've had more experience with parallel computing before but concurrency has been a little tougher for me.  I've been doing some <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> courses and reading <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action">Concurrency in Action</a>.

I'm trying to get a stronger feeling of values: specifically <i>rvalues</i> and <i>lvalues</i>.
