<p>The code base used for my work is pretty big and complex.  I worked on a pretty big codebase for numerical weather modeling in graduate school, and this is way bigger.  So of course it can be fairly tempermental with respect to changes in the development environment.  I spent several hours trying to fix something I thought I had done.  </p>

It was just changes to the tool chain.
