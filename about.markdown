<p>My name is Christian.  I'm a software engineer in the energy industry. Prior to my current role I processed seismic data (and <a href="https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/segam2021-3583063.1">wrote AI enabled machine learning systems for it</a>!).  Prior to <em>that</em> I was working on a PhD: research into ensemble weather forcasts (and how to make them better by inclusion of surface conditions!).

I'm interested in history (ancient & modern). egyptology, Catholicism, physics & math!  and running.  and cats.
