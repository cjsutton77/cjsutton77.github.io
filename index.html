            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently a geophysicist-turned-software developer at a large energy company.  Most of what I work on are large scale numerical codes (read: wave equation propagators) and other software applications for seismic data processing.  In the last year I've been involved with working on full waveform inversion and reverse time migration.  Below are some links if you'd like to learn more:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slim.gatech.edu/research/full-waveform-inversion">FWI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Reverse_time_migration">RTM</a></li>
</ul>
When I'm not at work I enjoy programming, puzzles, running, playing Legos with my kids, and reading. </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I've worked as a software developer, geophysicist (imaging & acqusition), and electrical engineer at IBM.</p>
            <p>Prior to this I did my graduate work in ensemble forecasting for convective storms.  My research invoved looking at the impact of soil moisture and land use to improving the variability of forecasts.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I have experience with signal processing (seismic), imaging, velocity model building, AI-enabled seismic processing, and scientific programming.</p>
            <p>C++, C, Python, FORTRAN (90, 77), Java, C#</b>
